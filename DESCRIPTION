Title: Inferring Developmental Chronologies from Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data
Version: 1.0.3.9001
Date: 2018-06-12
Description: An accurate and easy tool for performing trajectory inference on
  single cells using single-cell RNA sequencing data. In addition, SCORPIUS
  provides functions for discovering the most important genes with respect to
  the reconstructed trajectory, as well as nice visualisation tools.
